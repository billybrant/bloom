details and i ll get into those but there are also systemic issues that need consideration security is ultimately a function of user behaviors if users share account credentials then any no matter how robust authorization mechanisms are useless if systems administrators miss sensitive servers when applying critical patches then intrusions are trivially executed the most challenging component of these operational exposures is that people act rationally they take the easiest path they procrastinate when faced with tedium awkwardness or seemingly undue complexity a close second to the problem of rational behavior is that we make mistakes how does one minimze these operational exposures the key is to play to workers rational aversion to work to provide secure procedures which are the easiest to complete making secure outcomes the easiest to achieve the most potent tool is automation that is the removal of humans from security management processes the core bloom employs a system maintenance methodology called release management it s simple to describe but provides subtle yet profound benefits release management is a process principle where all manual changes to the system are made to a development instance and when complete and tested are replicated via an automated process to the production instance the production instance is never  manually modified for a variety of reasons eg version control software is used to accomplish the automation programmer types do this migration work release management is mistakenly seen as primarily benefiting the software development process and it does in dramatically reducing bugs in production systems but it s in the security realm that the greatest benefits arise consider a couple examples a patch to a serious security hole is released it s applied to development tested and then deployed to production systems to all the production systems identically and quickly optional yet attainable future features description effort

going to be using bloom for new data you haven t collected before then you are done but it s common for folks to already have research data and they want to use bloom for its additional features but they want the data they ve already collected to be imported into bloom import your existing data not so easy often downright challenging  the reason importing your data is hard is that it s usually messed up or you wouldn t be seeking a new system getting data out of antiquated systems is often challenging worst case you need to parse deprecated binary formats more commonly you can find free share ware utilities which is a much easier method another common problem is poor data modeling and hard to analyze values in fields we ve learned a lot over the last decade about data modeling that allows facile analysis older data models can be both extremely awkward to analyze and too imcomplete to model well my current impression is that the largest set of desired clinical research statistics lend themselves well to olap  tools and i therefore recommend boning up not only on the more standard  normalized relational modeling  but also on the star and snowflake schemas that lend themselves to olap data exploration whether i m write or wong about the alignment of clinimcal research to you really should spend the day to digest the links in this paragraph understanding of these structures and the distinctions between them will optimize your data modeling choices for bloom and those decisions excluding simple field adds and alters are a lot of work to structually change later hunh just as theyre hard to structually change now i m punting on the details for now to a pretty good writeup on what you click by somebody else  the steps i take are scrub your data as best you can in your legacy system this is typically a labor intensive and therefore error prone process have multiple teams independently delete bad data and edit erroroneous field values extract the mismatches and discuss the causes this becomes an iterative process of ever improving understanding of what your data means repeat until done generate a csv file of your data that matches the fields in your content type this actually goes both ways if you re porting a body of existing data you ll often want to design your content type to have fields that match your exported data create a header with field names in your csv then as necessary edit those names so all the letters are lower case replace spaces with underscores and save as utf8 now that you ve got a content type and csv export file of your existing data that match you click structure on the main menu and select feed importer add importer give it a name and an optional description and click create the links on the left of the main content each need to be reviewed and set but they re pretty straight forward below are some tips basic settings access to content type use standalone form periodic import off save fetcher select file upload save parser csv parser save processor node processor save node processor settings bundle select the content type you want to import save node processor mappings the source is the name for the field from your csv s header line and you ll be able to pick the target field for your content type from the pick list append import to your site s root url pick the importer you just made and hit import oh yeah you ve got to scrub again and it s tedious again see step 1 relative to this 7 again    ',0),(98,'node',' features bloom s features bloom is built on drupal which is a content
